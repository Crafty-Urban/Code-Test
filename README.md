######**1. Write a JavaScript program that hides/masks any type of contact info related to any user.**

**Input:**
```
Hello my name is ABCD, and I live in Dhaka. 
You can connect with me via my phone number 011123, or you can email me at abcd@gmail.com.
```
**Output:**

```
Hello, my name is ABCD, and I live in Dhaka. 
You can connect with me via my phone number ******, or you can email me at *************.
```

**Explanation:**

Phone number and email are a part of the contact info so this data will be masked.
